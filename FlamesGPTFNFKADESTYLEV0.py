# FlamesMix Dancer 1.0 PyDance
# Welcome, young game developer! This is a rhythm game engine similar to Kade Engine
# but optimized with GPT4. This code is written in a way that will be easy for you to
# understand, just like how game developers used to do back in the 2010s. Let's get started!

# We will be using the Pygame library to build our game, so let's import it
import pygame

# And let's also import some other essential modules
import os
import sys
import math

# Remember to set up Pygame before using it
pygame.init()

# These are some constants that we will use throughout the game. You can change these
# values later on if you want to customize your game!
SCREEN_WIDTH = 800
SCREEN_HEIGHT = 600
FPS = 60

# We need to create the game window using Pygame, this is how it's done:
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((SCREEN_WIDTH, SCREEN_HEIGHT))
pygame.display.set_caption("FlamesMix Dancer 1.0 PyDance")
clock = pygame.time.Clock()

# Now we will create a function that can help us load images from the "assets" folder.
# This function will automatically detect any .png files and load them for us.
def load_assets(folder):
    assets = {}
    for filename in os.listdir(folder):
        if filename.endswith(".png"):
            assets[filename] = pygame.image.load(os.path.join(folder, filename))
    return assets

# Let's load all the assets by calling the function we just created
assets = load_assets("assets")

# It's time to create a game loop! This is where all the magic happens. In this loop,
# we will keep updating our game's logic and rendering everything on the screen.
while True:

    # Let's start by handling any events that might occur
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        # If the user chooses to quit the game, we need to stop the game loop
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            pygame.quit()
            sys.exit()

    # Update the game's logic here!
    # As you learn more about how the game works, you can add your own code here
    # to make it even more awesome!

    # Now we need to draw everything on the screen
    screen.fill((0, 0, 0))  # Filling the screen with a black background

    # You can use the "screen.blit()" function to draw any assets (like images) on the screen
    # For example:
    # screen.blit(assets["example.png"], (x, y))  # Replace x and y with the desired position

    # To draw a simple rectangle on the screen, you can do this:
    # pygame.draw.rect(screen, (255, 255, 255), pygame.Rect(x, y, width, height))

    # After drawing everything, we need to update the screen
    pygame.display.flip()

    # Finally, let's control the game's speed using the "clock" object we created earlier
    clock.tick(FPS)

# End of the game loop! When you are ready to start building your game, you can
# start adding more code, functions, and classes to create an amazing rhythm game!
